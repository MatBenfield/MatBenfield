You can see my [curriculum vitae](/curriculum-vitae.md) and my [operating manual](/operating-manual.md). I also love listening to podcasts so please help me on the [agile software development podcasts](https://github.com/MatBenfield/agile_software_development_podcasts) repository

## Now

> Based on [the now page](https://thenow.page) and an idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)

- Playing with GitHub actions

- ~~Moving house~~
- run more / eat better
- Digital cleanse
- Read backlog of Kindle books

## Repository naming convention

repositories, where possible, are lowercase with underscores

- Normal repositories are named as they are, sometimes this might be a domain name e.g `thechels.uk`.
- Demonstrations or proof of concepts use the format `demo_name`.
- Template or boilerplates are named in the format `template_name`
  - where appropriate these are also published through github pages and will be available at `username.github.io/repo_name`
