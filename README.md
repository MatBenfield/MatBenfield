You can see my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/curriculum-vitae.md) and my [operating manual](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/ooperating-manual.md). I also love listening to podcasts so please help me find more on the [agile software development podcasts](https://github.com/MatBenfield/agile_software_development_podcasts) repository. I am also compiling a repository of [people leadership documentation](https://github.com/MatBenfield/people_leadership_documentation) too

## Repository naming convention

repositories, where possible, are lowercase with underscores

- Normal repositories are named as they are, sometimes this might be a domain name e.g `thechels.uk`.
- Demonstrations or proof of concepts use the format `demo_name`.
- Boilerplate or templates are named in the format `template_name`
  - where appropriate these are also published through github pages and will be available at `username.github.io/repo_name`
